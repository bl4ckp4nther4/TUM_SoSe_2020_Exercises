(context) Need to implement Monte Carlo Integration in python

(issue) Doing this in c++ is probably more time intensive,
        Python is more readable and can plot functions, which is very hard with C++
        The other alternative is doing it in matlab, also possible, probably a bit faster,
        but matlab is super heavy on this machine

(why do i care) i need the practise for the computational physics 2 exam
